Documentation sucks. Let us take care of it! Just click anywhere in your function and press `Alt + D` (`⌥ + D` on Mac).

Trelent uses AI to write documentation for your functions instantly.

### Supported Languages
Trelent currently supports C#, Java, JavaScript and Python docstrings. We default to the standard formats in each language (XML, JavaDoc, JSDoc, and ReST respectively). Support for additional docstring formats and languages is on our roadmap.

If you have any other suggestions we would love to hear from you at [contact@trelent.net](mailto:contact@trelent.net)!
